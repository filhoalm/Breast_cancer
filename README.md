## Is Ductal Carcinoma in Situ a Precursor or Low-Risk Variant of Invasive Breast Cancer? A Population Perspective

### Methods

Institute NC. Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER 9,) Program Populations (1975-2018). (www.seer.cancer.gov/popdata), National Cancer Institute, DCCPS, Surveillance Research Program, released May 2023. February 2022S ed.: National Cancer Institute, 2022.

#### Morphology

##### DCIS

'8201/2: Cribriform carcinoma in situ','8500/2: Intraductal carcinoma, noninfiltrating, NOS','8501/2: Comedocarcinoma, noninfiltrating','8503/2: Noninfiltrating intraductal papillary adenocarcinoma','8507/2: Intraductal micropapillary carcinoma','8523/2: Intraductal with other types of carcinoma in situ' AND {Extent of Disease.ER Status Recode Breast Cancer (1990+)} = 'Positive','Negative','Borderline/Unknown','Recode not available'

##### IDC

'8500/3: Infiltrating duct carcinoma, NOS','8523/3: Infiltrating duct mixed with other types of carcinoma' AND {Extent of Disease.ER Status Recode Breast Cancer (1990+)} = 'Positive','Negative','Borderline/Unknown','Recode not available'

### Results


Figure 1 shows the trends in the incidence of Infiltrating Ductal Cancer (IDC) and Ductal Carcinoma In Situ (DCIS) breast cancers relative to 1990, when ER status started to be recorded. A) depicts overall trends; B) depicts trends in younger women; and C) depicts trends in older women. The dashed line corresponds to a value of 1.
