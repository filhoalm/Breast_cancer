## Overview

This report provides a comprehensive analysis of malignant breast cancer incidence rates by molecular subtype, race and ethnicity, using data from the SEER12 registries.

-   **HR-positive/HER2-negative (HR+/HER2-)**: HR+/HER2-
-   **HR-negative/HER2-negative (HR-/HER2-)**: HR-/HER2-
-   **HR-positive/HER2-positive (HR+/HER2+)**: HR+/HER2+
-   **HR-negative/HER2-positive (HR-/HER2+)**: HR-/HER2+

## Methods

Data from SEER12 is available below.

### Transforming SEER22 Data into a 'rate' Object

The SEER22 database provides data in a long format, which is not directly compatible with the WebTool for analysis. Our primary task involves transforming these datasets into a 'rate' object format. This format is requisite to ensure that the data can be efficiently processed using WebTool.

For more detailed information on the structures and functionalities of 'rate' objects and best practices for analyzing SEER data, please consult the following research article:

You can access the repository and download the rate files using the following link:

[GitHub Repository for Breast Cancer Rate Files](https://github.com/filhoalm/Breast_cancer/tree/main/RCode%208-16-22)

# Categorize age into age groups
age_breaks <- c(0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, Inf)
age_labels <- c("0-4", "5-9", "10-14", "15-19", "20-24", "25-29", "30-34", "35-39", "40-44",
                "45-49", "50-54", "55-59", "60-64", "65-69", "70-74", "75-79", "80-84", "85+")
breast_cancer_data <- breast_cancer_data %>%

# Aggregate cases and py by the new age groups, race, year, and er
aggregated_data <- aggregate(cbind(cases, py) ~ age_group + race + er + year, data=breast_cancer_data, sum)

breast_cancer_data <- breast_cancer_data %>%
  mutate(id = paste(age, race, er, sep = "_"))

# Reshape 'cases' and 'py' to wide format
bc_cases_wide <- reshape(breast_cancer_data, idvar = "id", timevar = "year", direction = "wide", v.names = "cases")
bc_py_wide <- reshape(breast_cancer_data, idvar = "id", timevar = "year", direction = "wide", v.names = "py")

# Merge the 'cases' and 'py' data frames

years <- sort(unique(breast_cancer_data$year))
sorted_colnames <- unlist(lapply(years, function(y) c(paste0("cases.", y), paste0("py.", y))))

# Select columns in the order of 'id', then alternating 'cases.YEAR' and 'py.YEAR'
final_data <- merged_data %>%
  select(c(id, sorted_colnames))

# Split the 'id' back into 'age', 'race', and 'er' and convert them accordingly
final_data <- final_data %>%
  mutate(age = as.numeric(unlist(lapply(strsplit(id, "_"), `[`, 1))),
         race = factor(unlist(lapply(strsplit(id, "_"), `[`, 2)), 
                       levels = c("0", "1", "2", "3", "4", "5"),
                       labels = c("NHW", "NHB", "AIAN", "API", "HIS", "Unknown")),
         er = factor(unlist(lapply(strsplit(id, "_"), `[`, 3)),
                     levels = c("0", "1", "2", "3"),
                     labels = c("Positive", "Negative", "Borderline/Unknown", "Recode not available")),
         .keep = "unused")



# # Drop the 'id' variable and reorder the dataframe
# final_data <- final_data %>%
#   select(-id) %>%
#   select(age, race, er, everything())
# 
# View the results
# head(final_data)

```

To align with the improved text section, we provided an example of an R code that selects a specific combination of race and ER (Estrogen Receptor) status from the dataset and includes summary information—attributes.
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# NHW with Positive ER status
df <- subset(final_data, age >= 35 & age <= 84)
df1 <- subset(df, race == "NHW" & er == "Positive")
df2 <- df1[-(1:25)]  # Assuming you are removing columns for years not between 2010-2020, adjust as needed

# Create a dataframe with a single row and the same number of columns as df2
summary_info <- data.frame(matrix(NA, ncol = length(df2), nrow = 5))
colnames(summary_info) <- colnames(df2)

# Fill in the summary information
summary_info[1, 1] <- "Title: Breast Cancer"
summary_info[2, 1] <- "Description: NHW - Positive"
summary_info[3, 1] <- "Start Year: 2010"               # Enter the actual Start Year if available
summary_info[4, 1] <- "Start Age: 35"                  # Enter the actual Start Age if available
summary_info[5, 1] <- "Interval (Years): 1"            # Enter the actual interval if available

# Combine the summary information with the data
combined_data_nhw_positive <- rbind(summary_info, df2)

# View the combined data
head(combined_data_nhw_positive)
#combined_data_nhw_positive

# For each race anr ethnicity save the combined data to a CSV file, modifying the filename as needed
#write.csv(combined_data_nhw_positive, "C:/Users/filhoam/Desktop/Breast/Incidence/seer22/nhw_positive.csv", row.names = FALSE)

```

### Breast Cancer Rate Objects

To ensureaccess to pertinent data, a dedicated GitHub folder has been created, containing all rate files segmented by race, ethnicity, and ER (Estrogen Receptor).


### R Webtool functions

Repository that content all the functional components of WebTool. This central repository provides an array of functions designed for streamlining the analysis of epidemiological data.

For more detailed insights into the capabilities and applications of the WebTool functions, you are encouraged to consult the following reference:

```


Webtool provides specialized function designed to facilitate the execution of core operations. Two of the most essential functions:

#### csv2rates Function

The `csv2rates` function is a data transformation utility that converts data from CSV (Comma-Separated Values) files into the standardized 'rate' object format required by WebTool:

- **Reading the CSV file** that contains the epidemiological data.
- **Ensuring** that the data adheres to the required structure, including appropriate variable names and formatting.
- **Calculating rates** such as incidences or mortalities, normalized to the population at risk.
- **Returning a 'rate' object** that can be directly utilized in subsequent WebTool analyses.

This conversion is critical for ensuring that the data can be analyzed accurately and efficiently within the WebTool framework.


#### apc2fit Function
The `apc2fit` function implements the Age-Period-Cohort (APC) model fitting on the 'rate' objects. The APC model is widely used in epidemiology to examine how particular outcomes change over time and across different cohorts. This function allows researchers to:


## APC Parameters and Functions


```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# df1<-csv2rates("combined_data_nhw_positive")
# names(df1)
# lexis(df1)
# #
# M1<-apc2fit(df1)
# names(M1)
# M1$LocalDrifts
# lexis(M1)

```

Estimable age-period-cohort (APC) parameters and functions calculated by the web tool are summarized below, along with their respective nomenclature and interpretations.

```{r table1-apc-parameters, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(knitr)

We created a function and a loop to handle the high volume of files and analysis
Here is an illustrative example that demonstrates this refined approach:
 
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# # Function to read the CSV, fit the model, and create a data frame with additional columns
# process_file <- function(file_path, race, er_status) {
#   # Read file into rates (adjust csv2rates according to your function's needs)
#   rates <- csv2rates(file_path)
#   
#   # Fit the APC model
#   fit <- apc2fit(rates)
#   
#   # Extract the fitted temporal trends and convert to data frame
#   fitted_temporal_trends <- as.data.frame(fit$FittedTemporalTrends)
#   
#   # Add race and er_status columns
#   fitted_temporal_trends$race <- race
#   fitted_temporal_trends$er <- er_status
#   
#   return(fitted_temporal_trends)
# }
# 
# # Base directory path where files are stored
# base_path <- "C:/Users/filhoam/Desktop/Breast/Incidence/seer22/"
# 
# # Vector of file identifiers
# file_identifiers <- c("nhw_positive", "nhw_negative", "nhb_positive", "nhb_negative", 
#                       "his_positive", "his_negative", "api_positive", "api_negative")
# 
# # Initialize an empty list to store results
# all_results <- list()
# 
# # Loop through each file identifier
# for (identifier in file_identifiers) {
#   # Construct the full file path
#   file_path <- file.path(base_path, paste0(identifier, ".csv"))
#   
#   # Split identifier into race and ER status parts
#   parts <- unlist(strsplit(identifier, "_"))
#   race <- toupper(parts[1])
#   er_status <- toTitleCase(parts[2])
#   
#   # Process the file and store the result in the list
#   all_results[[identifier]] <- process_file(file_path, race, er_status)
# }
# 
# # If you want a combined data frame with all results
# combined_results <- do.call(rbind, all_results)
# 
# # View the combined results
# print(combined_results)
#  
# # Define a vector of column names to round
# columns_to_round <- c("Rate", "CI Lo", "CI Hi")
# 
# # Loop through each column name and apply the rounding function

We can observe a sharp drop in rates for the year 2020. The reason is the Covid-19 pandemic effect, which impacted oncology systems and diagnostic capacity. To address this, we will exclude the year 2020 and then estimate the Net Drift.
